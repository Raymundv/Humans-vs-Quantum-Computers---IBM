Game Summary 
Mission: 
We have developed a Quantum Game ‚Äú Quantum Maze‚Äù using IBM Qiskit and Godot. Our Aim is to introduce the players to the world of Quantum Computation. Quantum Maze helps the players to learn about Qubits, Quantum gates, Quantum Circuits, and Noise. 
History of Quantum Games:
Early history of computer games dates as far back as the history of digital computers. In 1950 one of the Ô¨Årst games on computers, Bertie the Brain, was exhibited in the Canadian National Exhibition . Its main purpose was to demonstrate the use of vacuum tubes (and light bulbs), and it did it by playing Tic-tac-toe. In 1951 Nimrod played the game Nim, again using vacuum tubes and light bulbs. There the purpose for developing a game for a computer was more of an educational kind, as it illustrated the then seemingly strange idea of programming principles and algorithms  One of the earliest if not the Ô¨Årst commercial game bearing the word ‚Äúquantum‚Äù in its title was called Quantum produced for Atari in 1982. There you enter a subatomic world to capture particles using optical trackball included in the game 
Story : 
In the Quantum world, your worst enemy is Noise. When the qubits interact with the noise it results in an uncontrollable change in the quantum states and causes a loss of information stored by the quantum computer. Your mission is to help the qubit to achieve a given target state by passing through a certain set of quantum gates and also avoiding the noise balls which are scattered around the maze.
Survival Tip: Be careful of noise balls, they are very powerful and can kill your quantum state with just one touch! 
How To Play:
Move the ball through the blocks. Each block represents a quantum gate.
Use the keypad to move through the maze.
You must avoid the noise objects, otherwise, you‚Äôll lose the game.
Watch the Gameplay/Walkthrough 
How to Install 
Set Python environment using  godot-python
Install Qiskit library for either Windows/MacOS
 	cd addons/pythonscript/(choose_operating_system) 				
Windows:
 	python.exe -m ensurepip 				 				 	
 	python.exe -m pip install qiskit 				 			
MacOS:
 	cd ox-64/bin 				 				 		
 	python3 -m ensurepip 				 				 	
 	python3 -m pip install qiskit 				 				
Challenges Faced
Since there has never been a quantum game that was developed using the Godot game engine, we ran into several roadblocks while developing Quantum Maze.
While developing the game we found that several qiskit packages like qiskit.visualization don‚Äôt work with Godot and so we redeveloped the game with access to only limited qiskit resources.
Software & Tools Used

Qiskit
Godot
Python
Git

Future Plans
Add more levels to introduce more quantum gates and different types of noise obstacles to the game. 
Introduce more quantum computing concepts eg. Entanglement, Quantum Tunneling, etc.
Introduce more graphics and animations in the Game 
Introduce multiple qubits to the game.
Introduce error correcting codes to the game which can help the player restore the state of qubit after they come in contact with the noise balls. 
Introduce engaging characters for the game storyline. Represent them as Qubits, state 0 being a bad person, and state 1 a good character. Through life experiences(quantum gates), the character chooses and affects its inner state, and then after a measurement (situation) decides to be either bad or good.
